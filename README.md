# Introduction

This site contains the materials for an Python course run by Peter Mac.

This workshop is designed to provide beginners with foundational understanding of Python programming language. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, hands-on coding exercises, and practical applications, participants will learn how to leverage Python for data analysis, manipulation and visualization of cancer biology datasets. 

The workshop will cover essential programming concepts and gradually introduce more advanced topics, with a focus on using the pandas library for efficient data handling, analysis and visualization. The aim of this workshop is to improve the reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research by teaching powerful tools in data analysis and creating informative plots.

# Data

The Metabric study characterized the genomic mutations and gene expression profiles for 2509 primary breast tumours. In addition to the gene expression data generated using microarrays, genome-wide copy number profiles were obtained using SNP microarrays. Targeted sequencing was performed for 2509 primary breast tumours, along with 548 matched normals, using a panel of 173 of the most frequently mutated breast cancer genes as part of the Metabric study.

Both the clinical data and the gene expression values were downloaded from
[cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric).

We excluded observations for patient tumor samples lacking expression data, resulting in a data set with fewer rows.
